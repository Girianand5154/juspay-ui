# Navigation Bug Fix - Sidebar Navigation Issue

## Problem
After opening the sidebar, navigation buttons to switch between ecommerce dashboard and order list page were not working.

## Root Cause
1. **Mobile/Tablet**: The backdrop overlay was capturing all click events and preventing them from reaching the sidebar navigation buttons
2. **Desktop**: The sidebar didn't have a proper z-index when open, causing it to be behind other elements
3. **Missing Desktop Backdrop**: Desktop users didn't have any backdrop to close the sidebar

## Solution Applied
1. **Fixed Mobile/Tablet Backdrop**: Added `pointerEvents: 'none'` to the backdrop overlay so clicks can pass through to the sidebar
2. **Fixed Desktop Z-Index**: Added dynamic z-index prop to ensure sidebar appears above other elements when open
3. **Added Desktop Backdrop**: Added a transparent backdrop for desktop users to close the sidebar
4. **Enhanced Event Handling**: Ensured proper pointer events configuration across all screen sizes

## Changes Made
- `src/App.js`:
  - Added `pointerEvents: 'none'` to mobile/tablet backdrop overlay
  - Added `zIndex` prop to SidebarEnhanced component
  - Added desktop backdrop for closing sidebar
- `src/components/SidebarEnhanced.js`:
  - Added `zIndex` prop support
  - Applied zIndex to main container

- [x] Fixed mobile/tablet backdrop click interference
- [x] Fixed desktop z-index issues

- [ ] Test navigation on desktop (should work now)
