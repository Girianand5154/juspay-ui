## Design Decisions, Challenges, and Improvements

- **Design Decisions:**  
  I have designed 2 pages which is eCommerce Dashboard and order list page which can be navigated using the sidebar. The design given for the assignment was created firstly, after that I thought of doing some changes to make it more intercative and good looking UI with motions and interactions.

- **Challenges Faced:**  
  I did face some difficulty in implementing the world map in eCommerce dashboard "Revenue by Locations" tile, but still I managed to bring it up similarly. But I will learn the implementation of the world map after this assignment, to do it for my future projects.


- **Improvements Made:**  
Core Theme Updates:
1) Updated color palettes with modern, trendy colors.
2) Enhanced typography with better font weights and spacing.
